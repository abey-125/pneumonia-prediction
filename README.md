pneumonia prediction with deep learning  using keras and VGG16


The dataset is downloaded from kaggle.com. Link for the same is given below.
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia 

Then we will use VGG16 model to predict 

we will use the already present imagenet weights and keep all layers trainable==False.

Because we only need to delete the last layer and make the last layer according to our intrest

All the other layers will help in feature extraction.
